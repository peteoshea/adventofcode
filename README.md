# Advent of Code

[![CI](https://github.com/peteoshea/adventofcode/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/peteoshea/adventofcode/actions)

My attempt at [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using Rust.

To save having to setup Rust this project contains a dev container so, when using VS Code at least, you should get the option to run up project in the container and everything should be setup ready to go.

To run the code you can use my [scripts-to-rule-them-all](https://github.com/peteoshea/scripts-to-rule-them-all):

```bash
./script/start
```

or you can just use cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```
